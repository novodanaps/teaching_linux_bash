    "# Learn GAWK programming language hands-on\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "GAWK is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "GAWK is one of the most popular and powerful scripting languages. It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems. It is also available for Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. It was created in the 1970s at Bell Labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "GAWK is a complete programming language. It has variables, control structures, user-defined functions, and so on. It also has built-in functions and operators for doing regular expression matching, string concatenation, file input/output, and so on. It is interpreted and dynamically typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GAWK vs AWK\n",
    "\n",
    "GAWK has many extensions over the original version of awk. It is upwardly compatible with the System V Release 4 version of awk. It also has many additional features. It is also backwardly compatible with the original version of awk. It is a superset of the original version of awk.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the extensions of GAWK over the original version of awk:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Additional data types: arrays, associative arrays, multidimensional arrays, and objects.\n",
    "* Additional control structures: do-while, for, switch, break, continue, and the three-argument form of the if statement.\n",
    "* Additional operators: **, ++, --, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ^=, and the ternary conditional operator.\n",
    "* Additional built-in functions: and(), asort(), asorti(), atan2(), close(), cos(), exp(), fflush(), gensub(), getline(), index(), int(), log(), match(), mktime(), rand(), sin(), split(), sprintf(), srand(), strftime(), substr(), systime(), tolower(), toupper(), and close().\n",
    "* Additional special patterns: BEGINFILE, ENDFILE, and the three-argument form of the if statement.\n",
    "* Additional command-line options: -f, -F, -M, -W, and -v.\n",
    "* Additional built-in variables: ARGC, ARGIND, ARGV, BINMODE, CONVFMT, ENVIRON, ERRNO, FIELDWIDTHS, FPAT, IGNORECASE, LINT, NF, NR, OFMT, OFS, ORS, RLENGTH, RS, RSTART, RT, SUBSEP, TEXTDOMAIN, and TEXTDOMAINDIR.\n",
    "* Additional features: \n",
    "    1. the ability to include source files with the include statement\n",
    "    1. the ability to load shared libraries with the load statement\n",
    "    1. the ability to use arbitrary-precision\n",
    "\n",
    "*In mordern Linux distributions, the awk command is a symbolic link to the gawk command. So, when you run the awk command, you are actually running the gawk command. The awk command is a symbolic link to the gawk command for backward compatibility.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "GAWK programs are made up of rules and actions. A rule is made up of a pattern and an action. Please read on. these concept will be explained below. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the general syntax of a GAWK program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```awk\n",
    "pattern { action }\n",
    "pattern { action }\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of pattern and action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```awk\n",
    "BEGIN { print \"Hello, world!\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `BEGIN` is a pattern which means that the action will be executed before the first input record is read.\n",
    "`{ print \"Hello, world!\"}` is an action which can be a single or multiple statements. In this case, action is a single statement which is to print the string \"Hello, world!\". An action is executed when a pattern matches the current input record.  The curly braces are required to designate an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When a rule matches the current input record, the action is executed. A pattern is made up of one or more patterns separated by newlines or semicolons. An action is made up of one or more statements separated by newlines or semicolons.\n",
    "\n"
